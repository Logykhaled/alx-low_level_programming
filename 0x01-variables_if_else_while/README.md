# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
This repository contains a series of tasks written in the C programming language to help you practice using variables, if-else statements, and while loops. The tasks aim to reinforce the fundamental concepts of programming in C and to provide you with a solid foundation for further learning in the language.

# Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

A C compiler (e.g., gcc)
A text editor or IDE (e.g., Vim, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code)


# Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x01-variables_if_else_while.git


Navigate to the project directory:

cd 0x01-variables_if_else_while

To run any of the tasks, navigate to the task directory (e.g., 0-positive_or_negative) and compile the C file:

cd 0-positive_or_negative
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.c -o positive_or_negative

Run the executable file:

./positive_or_negative
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program.

# Tasks
This repository contains the following tasks:

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
A program that assigns a random number to the variable n and then prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
