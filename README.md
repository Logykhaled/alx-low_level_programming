# alx-low_level_programming

This repository contains tasks for learning the basics of the C programming language. Each task involves writing a C program to solve a specific problem.

# Tasks
0. Preprocessor
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

1. Compiler
Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

2. Assembler
Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.

3. Name
Write a C program that prints a message followed by the name of the file it was compiled from.

4. Hello, puts
Write a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle", followed by a new line.

5. Hello, printf
Write a C program that prints exactly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,", followed by a new line.

6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation
Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
